    "Assume non-negative continuous random variable $T$, the time until an event of interest (e.g. time from start of subscription to churn). We characterize the random variable via its probability density function (PDF) and its cumulative distribution function (CDF). Say the PDF of $T$ is $f(t)$ and the CDF of $T$ is $F(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the **CDF** is defined as $F(t) = P(T<t)$, i.e. $F(t)$ is the probability that the event occurred by time $t$. $F(t)$ gives the proportion of population with the time to event value of less than $t$. Given the PDF $f(t)$ we get the CDF via\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F(t) = \\int_0^t f(x) dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the **survival function** $S(t)$ as $S(t) = 1 - F(t) = P(T\\geq t)$. $S(t)$ gives the probability that the event has not occurred by the time $t$ (e.g. $S(t)$ gives us the proportion of population with the time to event value more than $t$). Given the PDF $f(t)$ we can get $S(t)$ via \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ S(t) = \\int_0^{\\infty} f(x) dx$$\n",

    "We define the **hazard funtion** as the rate at which the event is taking place out of surviving population at any given time $t$. \"Out of the people who survived at time $t$, what is the rate of dying of those people?\". This takes the form\n",

    "$$ h(t) = \\lim_{dt \\to 0} \\frac{\\frac{(S(t) - S(t + dt))}{dt}}{S(t)} $$\n",

    "We can see there are two parts of this formula. \n",

    "First is the instantaneous rate of event:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{S(t) - S(t + dt)}{dt}$$\n",

    "this can be seen as the slope at any point $t$ of the **survival curve** (the rate of dying at time $t$). Assume the total population is $P$. Observe that $S(t) - S(t + dt)$ is the proportion of people who died in time $dt$ out of the people who had survived at time $t$. The number of people who survived at time $t$ is $S(t)*P$, and the number of people who survived at time $t+dt$ is $S(t+dt)*P$, so the number of people who died during time $dt$ is $(S(t) - S(t + dt))*P$. Thus the instaneous rate of people dying at time $t$ is \n",

Thus if we can divide the number of people who died in time $dt$ by the number of people survived at any time $t$, we get the hazard function which can serve as a measure of RISK of people dying out of people who had survived at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hazard function is not a density or probability. Instead we can think of it as the probability of failure in an infintesimally small time period between $t$ and $t+dt$, given that the subject has survived up until time $t$. Along this thinking, *hazard is a measure of risk*. The greater the hazard between times $t_1$ and $t_2$, the greature the risk of failure in this time interval. \n",
