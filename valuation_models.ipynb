    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a workbook for derivations and implementations of models that attempt to give value to different types of securities. Long term view is to develop a processing pipeline for automating fundamental analysis of a stock. Think of it as follows. In day to day work, an analyst researches equities for his or her firm. They go to their terminal of choice, look up metrics, pull them into Excel and run the numbers. Repetitive but essential. I also don't work as a securities analyst so I could be full of shit. My thinking is that most automation in finance is centered around math and using it to predict price fluctuations, especially over the short term. This can be useful, but I think computers can be useful in another, less saturated way. Remove human emotion from the analysis of an equity, and do the analysis faster than any human can. With the *pipeline* someone can feed it stocks to research, and it will pass each stock through a series of tests/metrics. It can then output a score of sorts giving its prediction for each stock (vide infra). Perhaps this is done already. Nonetheless, I want to make my own, for personal growth, to learn, and to understand. I want to make it as close to the Unix philosophy as I can. Data will be piped to methods that each \"evaluate\" a specific feature of a company. Each method will have a focused calculation or judgement that it needs to make, and it will modify the running score, then pass it onto the next method. This allows for future development - when a new method comes about, implement it and add it to the pipeline, customizability - add and remove stuff from the pipeline with ease, and could even be made into a GUI so no one has to get their hands dirty with Python. Even though I stated above that I want to focus the \"analyst checklist\" and automating that, my pipeline should be extenisble enough to add in ML/AI/probabilistic models/etc. to it as well. They can be implemented and passed in like any other method. The value add for my pipeline idea is that one can use it to check up on stocks they own or are considering owning regularly. Via automation, they can check on the entire market in one click. This allows analysts to maintain a long term (value-investing) type view, but automates the dirty work that goes into fundamental analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "The “supply” of an asset is the total market value of it in existence–the total number of outstanding units times the market price of each unit. Since the market price of cash is always unity, \\$1 for \\$1, its supply can only change in relative terms, relative to the supply of other assets.\n",

    "### The Unique Dynamics of Equity Asset Supply\n",
    "\n",
    "Trivially, if the aggregate investor is going to maintain a constant portfolio allocation to equities, the supply of equities must grow commensurately with the supply of cash and bonds.  Recall that investors, in aggregate, have to hold all of these assets at all times. It follows mathematically that the ratios of the total supplies outstanding must equal the ratios inside the “average” investor’s portfolio. \n",

    "- the dividends paid in the interim.\n",
    "\n",
    "Price is king and its the key to generating returns, but how is it determined? Because valuation is a learned perception, driven by anchoring and by social and environmental feedback, it tends to follow the market. Valuation metrics can be seen as a function of the current market environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asset Supply:  A New Framework for Thinking About Equity Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "Some imprecise equations\n",
    "\n",
    "> total return = price return + dividend return\n",
    "\n",
    "> price return = price return from P/E multiple change + price return from earnings growth (only realized if P/E multiple were to stay constant)\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining gives \n",
    "\n",
    "> total return = [price return from P/E multiple change + price return from earnings growth (only realized if P/E multiple were to stay constant)] + dividend return\n",
    "\n",
    "Value investing says P/E ratio's inverse correlation with long-term future returns is due to mean-reversion. If you buy at a price below the normal P/E range, you will get the dividend return, plus the return from earnings growth, plus the boost from multiple expansion. Thus your return will be higher than normal. Conversely, if you buy above the normal range, you will get the dividend return, plus the return from earnings growth–but those two gains will then be offset by losses from multiple contraction. Thus your total return will be lower than normal. This thinking doesn't model the real reasons a stock changes price. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposal**: new way to frame equity returns\n",
    "\n",
    "> total return = price return + dividend return\n",
    "\n",
    "> price return = price return from change in aggregate investor allocation to stocks + price return from increase in cash-bond supply (realized if aggregate investor allocation to stocks were to stay constant) \n",
    "\n",
    "Combining gives \n",
    "\n",
    "> total return = price return from change in aggregate investor allocation to stocks + price return from increase in cash-bond supply (realized if aggregate investor allocation to stocks were to stay constant) + dividend return \n",
    "\n",
    "In this new way of thinking, the supply of cash and bonds grows normally as the economy grows.  If the preferred allocation to stocks stays the same, the price has to rise (that is the only way for the supply of stocks to keep up with the rising supply of cash and bonds–recall that the corporate sector is not issuing sufficient new shares of equity to help out).  That price rise produces a return.  When the preferred allocation to equities increases alongside this process, it boosts the return (price has to rise to keep the supply equal to the rising portfolio demand).  When the preferred allocation to equities falls, it subtracts from the return (price has to fall to keep the supply equal to the falling portfolio demand).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, instead of saying that the P/E multiple is mean-reverting, the equity allocation preference is mean reverting. This way of thinking about stock market returns accounts for relevant supply-demand dynamics that pure valuation models leave out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average investor allocation to equities correlates well with S&P return. Seems to be better than other models mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on Overvaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "For the stock market to be \"overvalued\", it is currently valued more expensively than it typically has been in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Valuation\" - at least in the range that we’re currently at - is not one of the processes that cause markets to sell off (or, for that matter, that stop markets from selling off).  So stop worrying about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a model via FRED API and whatever other data source that tracks the average investor's allocation to equities, perhaps use this to try and predict where the S&P will head next, when is good time to be in and when is a good time to be out (based on what the average investor is doing). \n"
